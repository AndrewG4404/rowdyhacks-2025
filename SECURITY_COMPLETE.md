# ✅ Security Fix Complete!

**Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Status:** Git history cleaned, .env removed from GitHub

## What Was Done

### 1. Git History Cleaned ✅
- Removed `.env` from all commits using `git filter-branch`
- Force-pushed to GitHub (both `main` and `Andrew-branch`)
- `.env` is now **completely removed** from Git history

### 2. Git Sync Issue Fixed ✅
- Resolved branch divergence
- Local and remote branches are now in sync
- Working tree is clean

### 3. Verification ✅
```bash
# Confirmed: .env is NOT tracked by Git
# Confirmed: .env is NOT in local Git history
# Confirmed: .env is NOT in GitHub history (all branches)
# Confirmed: .gitignore is protecting .env files
```

## 🚨 CRITICAL: You MUST Still Rotate Credentials

Even though .env is removed from Git, the credentials were **already exposed on GitHub**. Anyone who accessed the repository during that time could have copied them.

### Immediate Actions Required:

#### 1. OpenRouter API Key ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Old key (EXPOSED):** `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`

**Action:**
1. Go to: https://openrouter.ai/keys
2. **Delete** the exposed key immediately
3. Create a **new** API key
4. Add to `.env.local` (see below)

#### 2. MongoDB Password ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Old password (EXPOSED):** `GlqodeTsag6kwBaj`

**Action:**
1. Go to: https://cloud.mongodb.com/
2. Database Access → Database Users
3. Edit user: `gonzalezandrew528_db_user`
4. **Change password** to a new strong password
5. Update connection string in `.env.local`

#### 3. Cloudinary API Secret ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY
**Action:**
1. Go to: https://console.cloudinary.com/settings/security
2. **Regenerate** API Secret
3. Update in `.env.local`

#### 4. Auth0 Setup (NEW)
You still need to set up Auth0:
1. Create tenant at https://auth0.com
2. Create Application (Regular Web App)
3. Enable Database + Google connections
4. Set callback URLs:
   - `https://www.fundmebabyonemoretime.us/api/auth/callback`
   - `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback`
5. Copy credentials to `.env.local`

## How to Set Up Your Local Environment

### Step 1: Create .env.local
```bash
cp env.example .env.local
```

### Step 2: Fill in NEW credentials
Edit `.env.local` with your rotated credentials:
- OpenRouter: NEW key
- MongoDB: NEW password  
- Cloudinary: NEW secret
- Auth0: Your new tenant credentials

### Step 3: Verify .env.local is ignored
```bash
git status
# Should NOT show .env.local
```

## For Your Team

Your teammates need to know about the force push:

**Message to send:**
```
🚨 Security Update: I force-pushed to remove exposed credentials.

Please run:
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main  # or origin/your-branch-name

All your local changes will be lost, so commit/stash first!
```

**Affected teammates:**

- @hugo-branch
- @rene-branch

## Vercel Environment Variables

Once you've rotated credentials:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/your-project/settings/environment-variables
2. **Delete ALL** existing environment variables
3. Add your **NEW** credentials
4. Set `NODE_ENV=production`
5. **Redeploy** your application

## Security Best Practices Going Forward

✅ **Always use `.env.local`** for local development (already in .gitignore)  
✅ **Never commit** `.env`, `.env.local`, or any file with credentials  
✅ **Use `env.example`** as a safe template (safe to commit)  
✅ **Store production secrets** in Vercel Environment Variables only  
✅ **Rotate credentials** every 90 days  
✅ **Different credentials** for dev/staging/production  

## Files in Your Project

- ✅ `.gitignore` - Protects all `.env*` files
- ✅ `env.example` - Safe template (contains NO secrets)
- ⚠️ `.env.local` - Your local secrets (CREATE THIS, don't commit)
- ⚠️ `.env` - Your current file (MOVE contents to .env.local, then DELETE .env)

## Quick Command Reference

```bash
# Check if .env is tracked
git ls-files | grep .env
# Should return nothing

# Check git status
git status
# Should show "nothing to commit, working tree clean"

# Verify .env.local is ignored
echo "test" > .env.local
git status
# Should NOT show .env.local
```
